# Environment Variables Configuration
# This file contains environment variables for development/demo purposes only
# In production, replace these with actual Stripe keys from your Stripe Dashboard

# Stripe Configuration
# This is a placeholder key for development - it won't process real payments
# Replace with your actual Stripe publishable key in production
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51H0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# Additional Stripe Configuration (if needed)
# STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... (Keep secret keys server-side only, never in NEXT_PUBLIC_)
# STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... (For webhook endpoint verification)

# Development Notes:
# - All NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables are exposed to the browser
# - Never put secret keys in NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables
# - Restart your development server after changing these values
# - In production, set these through your hosting platform's environment variable system
